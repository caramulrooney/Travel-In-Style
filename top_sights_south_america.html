                    <h3> Galapagos Islands, Ecuador</h3>
                    <p>The Galapagos Islands are a one-of-a-kind destination, located roughly 575 miles off the coast of Ecuador. This microcosm of evolution offers some of the best up-close-and-personal wildlife encounters on earth, with the chance to snorkel with sea lions and turtles, stroll across desolate lava fields and watch the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies. This is the ultimate nature lover’s paradise, and perhaps one of the last unspoiled places on the planet where the boundaries of Mother Nature continue to be respected. There is really no other place where you can see such a variety of wildlife in their natural state, unafraid of onlookers. As it’s unlikely to last forever, the islands are a must for any traveler’s list. </p>

                    <h3> Iguazu Falls, Argentina </h3>
                    <p> Iguazu Falls, one of the great natural wonders in the world, is one of the most breathtaking sights on earth, featuring more than 250 waterfalls that are surrounded by the tropical jungle of Argentina and Brazil. In comparison, Niagra Falls seems like just the drip of a faucet tap. The Argentine side is the best to visit, as you can get especially up close and personal with the falls, feeling the mist on your skin. Taking the thrilling boat ride will get you even closer, but be prepared to get drenched. You’ll also be amazed at the brightly colored parrots soaring in the skies above and chatter away in nearby trees. </p>

                    <h3> Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile </h3>
                    <p> The granite pillars of Torres del Paine, which soar for over 6,500-feet above the Patagonian landscape, dominate the scenery of what’s often been called South America’s finest national park. For those willing to venture to Patagonia, the southernmost region of Chile, you’ll find some of the most astounding hiking opportunities with trails meandering through emerald forests, passing azure lakes, roaring rivers, and even a brilliant, blue glacier. The park is also home to flocks of ostrich-like rhea, Andean condor and flamingo. Guanacos, a relative of the camel, were almost hunted to extinction, but after a decade of effective protection, the large and increasingly growing herds in the area no longer even flinch when a vehicle or human approaches. </p>

                    <h3> Lake Titicaca, Bolivia </h3>
                    <p> South America’s largest lake is the home to a number of indigenous communities that offer a fascinating glimpse into the history and culture of Peru. You can’t just go to the lake, you’ll need to get out on the water by boat. Close to shore, it appears rather murky, but the further out you go, the more it becomes a clear, vibrant Mediterranean-like blue. Visiting the floating islands of the Uros people, a cluster of 60 islands, about a 40-minute boat ride from the main port at Puno, you can spend time with the local families whose ancestors have inhabited the islands for decades. Learn how they live, educate their children, share food, cook and maintain the condition of the islands. </p>

                    <h3> Machu Picchu, Peru </h3>
                    <p> Of course, Machu Picchu is on the top of many travelers’ bucket lists. Hidden high within Peru’s Andes Mountains, this mystical city remained a secret for ages, with its existence only becoming well known after Hiram Bingham’s discovery was published in a 1911 book, Across South America. Today, it’s South America’s best known archaeological site, with much of the Incan architecture and design well-preserved. The site features the almost always mist-shrouded Huayna Picchu Mountain, which rises for nearly 1,000 feet above the stone ruins, terraces and plazas. Some travelers choose a train ride to enjoy the view in comfort, while others choose to walk the Inca Trail for several days with the sight of the ruins as their reward. </p>

                    <h3> Amazon, Quito, Ecuador </h3>
                    <p> The Amazon is an enormous region that covers 40 percent of the South American continent, touching many countries, though one of the more popular entryways is in Ecuador’s capital city, Quito. Exploring one of the world’s most unique ecosystems, you’ll have the opportunity to see all types of wildlife, including everything from monkeys, jaguars and brilliant birds to caimans, iguanas and anacondas. There are practically an endless number of tours to choose from. Sacha Lodge, located within a 5000-acre private ecological reserve, offers an accessible yet pristine rainforest sanctuary for enjoying a true jungle adventure in safety and comfort. </p>

                    <h3> Angel Falls, Venezuela </h3>
                    <p> Nestled within Canaima National Park, Angel Falls is the world’s highest waterfall. This astonishing cascade tumbles 3,212 feet – 19 times higher than Niagara Falls, which stands 170 feet at its highest point. Aside from the jaw-dropping scale of the falls, the remote location makes it a much less-visited attraction, located 1000 miles southeast of Venezuela’s capital of Carcas and 160 miles southeast of Ciudad Bolivar. Seeing it requires a boat ride up the Churun River, a flight over the top or a jungle trek through grasslands, rivers and mountains. No matter how you get there, it makes for a fun adventure that is more than worth the reward. </p>

                    <h3> Easter Island, Chile </h3>
                    <p> Easter Island is one of the most alluring sacred sites on the planet. While people mostly visit to see the moai, the amazing monolithic statues carved from a single piece of stone that are numbered around 1,000 and scattered throughout the island, this volcanic archipelago in the southeast Pacific is a vibrant center of unique Polynesian culture and extraordinary scenery. Visitors can soak in the sun on two white sand beaches or enjoy surfing, scuba diving and snorkeling after a morning of admiring the moai. </p>

                    <h3> Fernando de Noronha, Brazil </h3>
                    <p> Few people can claim they’ve experienced the unspoiled, magnificent beaches of Fernando de Noronha, an archipelago of 21 islands and islets located off the northeast coast of Brazil. In 1988, the majority of the main island, a 7.1-square-mile island, was declared a marine national park, and now just 420 tourists are allowed at any given time. Those who are lucky enough to visit will find inspiring natural beauty everywhere they look, at land or at sea. The rugged landscape features soaring rock sculptures, cascading waterfalls and natural pools, while pristine white beaches are nestled beneath jagged cliffs. Divers and snorkelers will find that the crystal blue waters are teeming with colorful fish, turtles, dolphins, lobsters and corals. </p>

                    <h3> Huacachina, Peru </h3>
                    <p> This small but fascinating city offers a unique destination for those that like to venture off the beaten path. This beautiful oasis in the middle of the dessert is located an hour away from the Pacific Ocean in southern Peru.  Built in the 1930s, resorts and restaurants line a turquoise colored lagoon that’s surrounded by massive sand dunes, offering the opportunity to sand board or four-wheel across them in buggies at break neck speeds. For only around $15, depending on your bargaining abilities, you’ll be taken on what feels like a death-defying ride across the huge hills that never seem to end. You might want to peer into the lagoon while you’re there – legend has it that a mermaid lives within its waters. </p>
