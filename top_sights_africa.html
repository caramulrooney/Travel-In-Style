                    <h3> Tanzania </h3>
                    <p> A photo won't capture the thunder of hooves on dirt as more than a million wildebeest and several hundred thousand zebra make their annual migration, but still, this is one for the top of the pile. The migration is actually a year-round event as the animals move from Tanzania's Ngorongoro Reserve in January, up through the Serengeti around June and hit Kenya's Masai Mara around September, before journeying south again. </p>

                    <h3> Table Mountain, South Africa </h3>
                    <p> Table Mountain makes Cape Town, one of the world's best beach cities, also one of the world's most photogenic. Cable car rides are available to the top of the mesa, giving great views, fantastic sunrises/sunsets and a great photo. Challenge: try and limit yourself to 50 pics. </p>

                    <h3>  Djmaa el Fna, Morocco </h3>
                    <p> The world's most exciting town square, Djmaa el Fna reminds you you're in Africa. In the heart of the old city of Marrakech, snake-charmers, henna-painters, story-tellers, date-sellers and orange juice vendors set up their stalls in the sleepy heat of the afternoon. As night falls, the vendors are joined by tribal drummers, ladyboy dancers and mobile restaurateurs selling delicious grilled meats, bread and salad as the smoke rises above their stalls till past midnight. </p>

                    <h3> Sossusvlei Dunes, Namibia </h3>
                    <p> Sossusvlei means "the gathering place of water" but you'll need to bring your own if you don't want to dehydrate at this, Namibia's most outstanding attraction. The dunes have developed over millions of years, the result of material flowing from the Orange River into the Atlantic, carried north and returned again to land by the surf. Climbing the dunes yields breathtaking views, including the Deadvlei, a ghostly expanse of dried white clay punctuated by skeletons of ancient camelthorn trees. </p>

                    <h3> Victoria Falls, Zambia and Zimbabwe </h3>
                    <p> One of the world's most majestic water spectacles, Victoria Falls (also called Mosi-oa-Tunya, or "The Cloud That Thunders) -- were reportedly first seen by a European when Scotsman David Livingstone journeyed here in 1855. Since then thousands have enjoyed the spray from the 108-meter high cascade, which was once recorded flowing at 12,800 cubic meters per second -- double that of Niagara's highest flow. </p>

                    <h3> Spitzkoppe, Namibia </h3>
                    <p> The Spitzkoppe feature various granite peaks in Namibia's Namib Desert, with the highest peak hitting nearly 1,800 meters. Activities in the area include bouldering and rustic cave camping as well as multiday safaris. </p>

                    <h3> Nyika Plateau National Park, Malawi </h3>
                    <p> Nyika, Malawi's largest park, is one of the most unusual in Africa with a plateau cut by numerous rivers that reach Lake Malawi by way of waterfalls off the eastern edge of the mountains. The eastern border of the plateau forms the wall of the Great Rift Valley. The great domes of hills have gentle slopes, making Nyika perfect for both trekking and mountain biking as well as Jeep exploration. Antelope and zebra abound, and the park has one of the highest densities of leopard in Central Africa. </p>

                    <h3> Makgadikgadi Pans, Botswana </h3>
                    <p> It's said you can hear your own blood flow in this vast area of dried-up salt pans in the Kalahari Desert, a forbidding landscaped formed by a huge lake that dried up millennia ago. But it can transform in an instant during winter, if rains have been good enough to make lush grass sprout, bringing a stampede of wildlife to break the silence including zebra, wildebeest and flamingos. </p>

                    <h3> The Southern Cross, Zambia </h3>
                    <p> This iconic formation in the night sky is best seen from the Southern Hemisphere, and few spots offer better vantage points than on an open-air safari in Luangwa, Zambia. The constellation has appeared in various cultures in various ways, not least with a reference in the Australian national anthem. </p>

                    <h3> Bazaruto Archipelago, Mozambique </h3>
                    <p> The 10-minute helicopter ride across the Bazaruto Archipelago to the Azura Retreats lodge on Benguerra Island is worth it in its own right. The destination is the icing on the cake. This award-winning boutique hotel set on a remote desert island is set within a Marine National Park, giving the chance to see whales, dolphins and dugong. </p>
